<summary><strong>ocean_view.py</strong></summary>

**Task:**  
You're given a list of building heights and a direction ("EAST" or "WEST"). Return the indices of buildings that have an ocean view — i.e., no taller building blocks their view in the given direction.

**Constraints:**  
- 0 <= len(heights) <= 10⁵  
- 0 <= heights[i] <= 10⁹  
- direction ∈ {"EAST", "WEST"}

<summary><strong>two_sum.py</strong></summary>

**Task:**  
Given a list of integers and a target number K, return True if any two distinct numbers in the list add up to K. Otherwise, return False.

**Constraints:**  
- The same element cannot be used twice.
- The list may contain both positive and negative numbers.
- Aim for better than O(n²) time complexity.

<summary><strong>decode_ways.py</strong></summary>

**Task:**  
Given an encoded message containing digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it using the following mapping: 'A' → "1", 'B' → "2", ..., 'Z' → "26".

**Constraints:**  
- The input string contains digits only.
- '0' cannot stand alone; it must be part of "10" to "26" to be valid.
